Practical Web Dev Assignment 4

I tried for like two hours straight to publish on github pages, but I think I just messed up the structure too much by creating my app inside an already-initialized repo. I know there's a way but I'm tired of trying to get it so I'm just forsaking the extra credit.

Thank you so much for the extension!
